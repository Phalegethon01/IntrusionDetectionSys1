This is a 4th year Btech computer science project made as a final major project. This runs with python as it's core and about front-end and back-end you already know or if you don't kindly read it understand by yourself. This project is done by students of Jk Lakshmipat University. Their names are Vinit Nihala and Upamanyu Kashyap. To run the code run app.py file using python3 app.py or using the play button in VS code. You should also keep in mind that an application called windows Npcap is required to be download for the code to run properly as it enables you with the scanning part. (For more information kindly use google or documentation from the company) By reading this you must have got an idea that it works for Windows, as for Mac I don't know cause I don't have it ;) Happy coding!!
